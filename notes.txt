Licence :
the bundle can be used and distributed under the terms of the gpl2

node.js:
nodejs is not required because i have precompiled mopabootstrap (for me works better).
I saved the compiled files in /components
if you need some security you can use basic authorization
directly configuring apache or configuring symfony

for now the bundle can be used only for data entry and presentation of collected data
in other words you go to the central archive of some city and consult old powdered paper registers
populate the database by hand with the goal to process the data with some other tool.

todo:
- translate boolean fields for the search panel
- change the behavior of the search panel for the fields which are mapped to numbers but we remapped to strings (marital status etc)
  or make those fields strings and do translation from database directly
- translations other than english and italian (the most part is done because all the strings are already passed to |trans)
  (refer to the italian translation as a base for other languages because the english part contains only a subset of key phrases.)
- add helper tables for places, cities, names, professions
- implement ajax auto-complete for those tables
- add a locus/resort field where and when needed (is not uncommon for old towns to have resorts/locus registered in documents i guess)
- delete unneeded fields (in italy multiple names are uncommon could it be possible to have say a person with 4 names?)
- add other fields? delete some?
- investigate how to connect or export data for other programs to process (genealogy graph software, gramps)
    maybe apy/datagrid export capabilities are ok for the task
- data export (csv,xml,sqlite format, microsoft access ???)
- characterize collected data by city or parish because at the moment the only possible thing is to change the name of the configured database
    so if you collect data from saint Paul parish you name the database saint_paul generate the schema for it and use it
    if one has many archives could be difficult to change the db name every time
- some statistics? some bar or circle graph?
